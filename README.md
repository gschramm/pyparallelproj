# pyparallelproj

`pyparallelproj` is **obsolete**. The python interface to the paralleproj OpenMP / CUDA TOF sinogram and listmode projectors
have been **completely integrated into the `parallelproj` package**.

Please visit the official docs of `parallelproj` [here](https://parallelproj.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) including install
instructions, documentation and many examples.
